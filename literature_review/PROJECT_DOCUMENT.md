## 1. Project Context

This project is developed in collaboration with the Department of Civil Engineering at Aalborg University, leveraging the unique opportunities provided by AAU BUILD. It was constructed in 2016, serves as both a functional academic facility and a cutting-edge Living Lab for building performance research and experimentation.

Located at Thomas Manns Vej 23 in Aalborg, Denmark, TMV 23 is a multi-storey office building spanning approximately 9,000 m² across five floors and one basement level. The building houses around 150 staff employees and 600 students, accommodating diverse functions including offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, workshops, and laboratories. As a Living Lab, TMV 23 enables real-world experimental setups and investigations to be conducted directly within the active working environment of staff and students.

The building is equipped with an extensive sensor network and building management system (BMS) that monitors various environmental parameters including light levels, temperature, CO2 concentrations, room occupancy, and humidity. The facility features 14 ventilation systems with varying capabilities, radiators, radiative panels, and three cooling units, all managed through a Schneider EcoStruxure BMS. Additionally, the building incorporates sustainable energy features such as photovoltaic panels and district heating connectivity.

Despite this high level of automation and sophisticated infrastructure, the current control systems operate independently without collaboration or integration. These simple controllers face significant challenges from dynamic environmental conditions including weather variations, heat generation from lighting and occupancy, and complex interactions between different building systems. The lack of coordinated control strategies represents a significant source of inefficiencies and oscillations. 

The TMV 23 facility provides an ideal testbed for developing and validating intelligent building management solutions, offering both comprehensive sensor data and interfaces for deploying and testing automated control algorithms in a real-world environment. This project aims to leverage this unique infrastructure to develop advanced control methodologies that can integrate multiple data sources and coordinate building systems for improved energy efficiency and occupant comfort.
