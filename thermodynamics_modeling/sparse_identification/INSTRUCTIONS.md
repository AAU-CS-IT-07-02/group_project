The steps for creating a venv:
- change the directory to the directory of your project
- run ```python3 -m venv your_venv_name```
- run ```.\your_venv_name\Scripts\Activate.ps1``` for Windows PowerShell
- run ```source myfirstproject/bin/activate``` for linux or macOS
- install the requirements using the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- you can use whatever IDE you want, I have attached links for JetBrains PyCharm and JupyterLab
- when you are done using the venv run the command "deactivate" in the Windows PowerShell
